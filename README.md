# Binary Classification using logistic regression kNN and ensemble methods
This project is from the CoE 4SL3 Fundamentals of Machine Learning course

Part 1: Logistic regression and k-nearest neighbours for binary classification has been experimented. The “Wisconsin breast cancer” data set was used for the experiments. There are 30 features 
and two classes in this dataset: “malignant” (the positive class), and “benign” (the negative class).

Part 2: Ensemble methods (bagging, random forest and boosting) has been experimented. The “spambase” data set was used for the experiments. There are 57 features and two classes in this dataset: “spam” (label 1), and “nonspam” (label 0).
